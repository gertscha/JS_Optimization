<h1>JS Lib Documentation</h1>


<h2 id="Background" class="ignoreLink">Background</h2>

<p>This is part of a graded project for the course Optimization Methods for Engineers (227-0707-00L)
  at ETH Zurich during the spring semester 2023.
  The goal is to implement an optimizer for a chosen problem and write a report about the results.</p>

<p>The chosen problem is Job Shop scheduling, where a set of N tasks need to be scheduled on M machines.
  Each tasks consist of subtasks that have a processing order, varying processing times and need to be
  processed on a specific machine.
  A machine can only process a single subtask at a time and subtasks are non-preemptable.</p>

<p>The goal is to compare the results of different Simulated Annealing implementations.
  In particular, I will examine how different (random) step procedures and search space representations
  affect the quality of the results.</p>

<h2 id="file_formats">File Formats</h2>

<p>Problems and Solutions are stored and read from text files.
  There are three file formats, two for Poblems and one for Solutions.
  The required formats are detailed in the next sections</p>

<h3 id="problem_format">Problem Description</h3>

<p>A Job Shop problem consists of Tasks, a Task consists of Steps, a single Step runs on a specific machine
  and takes a set amount of time.</p>

<p>This project supports two formats, called <b>Standard</b> and <b>Detailed</b>. For custom problems the
  Detailed format is recommended because it allows for more consistency checks during parsing.</p>

<p> The Standard format was introduced to be compatible with the <a href="http://jobshop.jjvh.nl/index.php">
  JobShop Instances</a> that were/are researched and have known optima.</p>

<h4 id="problem_format_detailed">Detailed Format</h4>
<p>The format to define a problem in the <b>Detailed</b> format is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first line contains two numbers: 'task count' and 'machine count', they specify how many tasks
      and how many machines the problem contains</li>
  
    <li>Every line afterwards defines exactly one <b>task</b>. This is done by first specifying the number of Steps the
      Task has. Then each Step is specified by a pair that defines the 'machine' and 'duration' of the Step.
      The sequence of the steps on a line defines the order in which the Steps need to be prcessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Step defintions to be legal 'machine' has to be in the range [0,machine_count] and 'duration' must
  be >= 0. All values must be integers. The number of tasks must also match the number of tasks that
  was specified.</p>
<p>The comma can be replaced by any character or removed altogether.</p>
<p>During parsing the first continous block of lines starting with '#' will be ignored as comments.</p>

<p class="example"></p>
<pre># comment lines are possible, no identation allowed before '#'
3 5
6, 0 8, 3 6, 4 10, 0 3, 1 9, 2 5
4, 3 4, 0 12, 4 16, 3 8
7, 4 19, 2 8, 0 6, 1 10, 3 7, 1 5, 2 9
</pre>

<h4 id="problem_format_standard">Standard Format</h4>
<p>The format to define a problem in the <b>Standard</b> format is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first line contains three numbers: 'task count' and 'machine count' and 'lower bound', they specify
      how many tasks and how many machines the problem contains as well as the known optimal lower bound</li>
  
    <li>Every line afterwards defines exactly one <b>task</b>. This is done by giving a pair for each Step is specified
      by a pair that defines the 'machine' and 'duration' of the Step. The sequence of the steps on a line
      defines the order in which the Steps need to be prcessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Step defintions to be legal 'machine' has to be in the range [0,machine_count] and 'duration'
  must be >= 0. All values must be integers.</p>
<p>Any white-space separator works, including multiple ones. The Problems in the Instances folder use tabs.</p>

<h3 id="solution_format">Solution Description</h3>

<p> Solutions have one format. The Python visualizations scripts that create Gnatt Charts depended on this to
  parse Solutons, in particular the comma separator is mandatory.</p>
<p>The format to define a problem in the <b>Standard</b> format is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first line is the name of the Solution. This is accessible if the Solution is loaded in the C++
      program and it will be displayed in the Python visualizations.</li>
    <li>The second line contains two numbers: 'task count' and 'machine count', they specify how many tasks
      and how many machines the Solution contains</li>
    <li>Every line afterwards corresponds to a <b>machine</b>. The first number is the number of Steps the
      Machine processes. After that there is a six-tuple for each Step. The tuples are separated by commas
      and have the format: 'task id' 'step index' 'machine' 'duration' 'start time' 'end time' </li>
</ul>

<p>The Steps and Tasks that can be reconstructed from the Solution must match the Problem it should solve.
  This can be checked with the Solution::validateSolution() function for arbitrary pairs of Solutions and Problems.</p>

<p>During parsing the first continous block of lines starting with '#' will be ignored as comments.</p>
